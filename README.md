## Kaldi ASR Scripts

This folder contains Kaldi-based speech recognition scripts used for
converting live microphone input into text.

### Current Status
- Uses standard Kaldi ASR pipeline
- Supports English and Tanglish speech input
- Generates text output used by the pictogram module

### Note
The Kaldi scripts used here are based on commonly available Kaldi recipes.
They are currently integrated at a functional level for demonstration
purposes.

### Future Work
- Script optimization
- Improved language modeling
- Better handling of mixed-language (Tanglish) speech
